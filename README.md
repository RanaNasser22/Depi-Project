# SUNSMART HOMES
A smart construction project introducing advanced smart homes in Egypt. These houses integrate modern smart features with solar panels that store energy to power the entire home, reducing reliance on the national electricity grid and lowering electricity bills.

# Project Idea
A construction initiative to market and build smart homes equipped with advanced features not yet available in Egypt.  
Each home is topped with solar panels that store and supply energy, allowing residents to power their homes independently, reducing pressure on the national grid, and lowering monthly electricity costs.

The system integrates:

1- Smart home features to enhance comfort, security, and efficiency.

2- Solar panel systems to generate and store electricity.

3- Automated energy management for optimal usage of stored solar power.

4- Mobile app integration to monitor home energy usage and savings.

5- Sustainable construction practices aligned with Egypt’s energy-saving goals.

By combining smart home technology with renewable energy, the project offers a modern, eco-friendly, and cost-saving housing solution for Egypt.

# Project Target
1- Introduce smart home technology with advanced features to the Egyptian market.  

2- Reduce dependence on the national electricity grid through solar energy.  

3- Help residents lower their electricity bills with renewable power.  

4- Support the government’s efforts in solving the energy crisis.  

5- Promote sustainable and eco-friendly construction in Egypt.  

6- Build modern, future-ready communities powered by clean energy.
