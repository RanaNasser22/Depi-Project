# ENERGUARD
An AI-powered smart electricity management system that monitors real-time household consumption. Using IoT sensors and AI analytics, it sends alerts when usage increases, predicts possible bill costs, and automatically turns off lights, fans, or ACs in empty rooms to ensure energy efficiency and cost savings.

# Project Idea
A national AI-powered electricity consumption management system designed to reduce energy waste, control bills, and support sustainable power usage.
The system integrates:

1- Mobile app for households to monitor consumption and receive alerts.

2- IoT device connected to the electricity meter to track real-time usage.

3- AI algorithms to analyze patterns, predict bill increases, and send notifications.

4- Smart sensors in homes to detect empty rooms and automatically switch off lights, fans, or ACs.

5- Integration with national electricity systems to support efficient energy management.

By combining AI, IoT, and Big Data, the project helps citizens reduce unnecessary electricity consumption, cut costs, and contribute to solving Egypt’s energy crisis.

# Project Target
1- Rationalize electricity consumption and save energy for the state.

2- Help citizens monitor and control their electricity bills.

3- Send real-time alerts when consumption increases.

4- Automatically reduce waste by turning off unused appliances in empty rooms.

5- Support national efforts in solving the electricity crisis and ensuring sustainable usage.

6- Build a centralized database for electricity consumption monitoring.
