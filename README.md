- **Integration with solar energy:** Not just smart homes or solar systems, but one connected ecosystem that tracks solar energy use, calculates savings, and alerts users about maintenance needs.  
- **Affordable for the middle class:** While competitors focus on luxury villas, Eterna delivers practical, accessible solutions for the middle class.  
- **Community-level Digital Twin:** Beyond individual homes, residents can monitor shared energy efficiency, infrastructure performance, and savings across the compound.
